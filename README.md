# Stack-Queue
Stack &amp; queue implementation. 

Design a queue data structure, using a singly-linked list, such that it supports following operations:
getMin(): returns the minimum elements of the queue (Currently present, deleted ones are not taken into account).
enque(element): adds an element "element" in the queue.
deque(): removes the first element present from the queue.

Given an expression string exp, write a program that uses stacks implemented via arrays, to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“, “}”, “(“, “)”, “[“, “]” are correct in the given expression.
